# Current objectives by current priority:


0. How to use cluster
1. Implement autoencoder algorithm
1.1 Implement Error reconstruction function
1.2 Learn how to use something like weights and biases or simply put them in a .txt, idk
2. Train autoencoder algorithm on healthy patients Cropped dataset
2.2 Once again store the weights and biases
3. Implement Adaptative thresholding
4. Implement Roc function visualizer
5. See how good we did (given the mixed dataset (annotated), use the AE & adaptative thresholdign algorithms).
   Then display

6. Implement classifier
6.......  

7. Document and presentation
